# Quick Start Guide for the Project

Step 1: Read the `Introduction.md` file to understand the project style and content. It contains a functional description of the Qualcomm version of XLeRobot. The images used in the introduction are stored in the `images_intro` folder and do not need to be reviewed for now.

Step 2: Check the principle introduction in the `Principle` document. A quick browse will help developers gain a basic understanding of the underlying principles.

Step 3: Review the `Hardware_List` document, which lists all required hardware components for the project with purchase links. Developers can source the materials independently.

Step 4: Examine the 3D models in the `3D_Printing_Models` folder, which contains all printable parts for the project. Developers can print the components as needed.

Step 5: Browse the `Assembly_Steps_and_Structure_Diagram` folder. It includes assembly instructions for the robotic arm, chassis, and top mount, along with an installation tutorial video and structural diagrams to assist with hardware assembly.

Step 6: Study the wiring diagrams in the `Wiring_Diagram` folder to learn how to connect all components.

Step 7: After hardware assembly and wiring are complete, refer to the `Set_Servo_ID` folder, which explains how to set and number IDs for all servos.

Step 8: With all hardware work finished, proceed to the `Code_Resources` folder for software‑level instructions. It includes a `README.md` file that details the software implementation of the robot.

(Optional) You may watch the `Demonstration.mp4` file, which is the project demo video.
